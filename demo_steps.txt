Demo Script (3-5 minutes)

1) One-line intro (15s)
   - "Hello, we built a modular Mental Health chatbot using MeTTa, OpenAI, and Agentverse uAgents."

2) System overview (30s)
   - Show architecture diagram verbally: Client Agent -> Server Agent -> Chatbot Service (MeTTa + embeddings) -> OpenAI.

3) Live demo (90s)
   - Start server agent (show logs).
   - Start client agent (show prompt), enter: "I'm feeling anxious at work — what can I do?"
   - Show server receives query, background task processing, and reply returned.
   - Point out 'sources' metadata printed with the reply to show RAG.

4) Explain safety (30s)
   - Show system prompt includes crisis guidance; mention emergency resources are provided.

5) Implementation highlights (30s)
   - Mention modular separation: agents are lightweight, heavy work in `chatbot_service.py`.
   - Mention using `text-embedding-3-small` for embeddings and how we ensured dimension consistency.

6) Wrap up (15s)
   - "This is extensible — more agents (triage, referral) can be added. Links & code are in the repo."
